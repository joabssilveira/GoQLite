# Changelog

All notable changes to **GoQLite** will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## v0.3.1

### ✨ Added
- Support for unlimited-depth relational filters using dot notation  
  It is now possible to filter fields across multiple relationship levels, such as:
  - `course.name`
  - `course.course_group.name`
  - `course.course_group.realm_name`
  - `a.b.c.d.field`

### 🚀 Improved
- Relational path resolution now dynamically walks through the full GORM relationship chain
- JOINs are now generated in a properly chained manner, linking parent → child aliases across all levels
- Final fields are now resolved based on the schema of the last model in the relationship chain

### 🛠 Fixed
- Fixed duplicate JOIN detection logic to prevent incorrect JOIN reuse  
  The check now considers the full JOIN clause instead of only the alias:
  ```go
  if !hasJoin(db, join) {
      db.Joins(join)
  }

## [v0.3.0] - 2026-01-29

### ✨ Added
- Generic `JSONB[T]` type for seamless PostgreSQL JSONB support  
  - Implements `sql.Scanner` and `driver.Valuer`  
  - Compatible with GORM and `database/sql`  
  - Includes `MarshalJSON` and `UnmarshalJSON` to expose clean JSON in APIs (no wrapper field)  
  - Supports persistence of slices, structs, maps, and pointer types as JSONB  
  - Centralizes JSONB handling inside GoQLite, removing the need for per-project boilerplate

- Typed update resolver support via `UpdateStructResolver[T]`  
  - Allows update handlers to receive strongly typed payloads  
  - Brings update flow in line with the existing `GormCreateHandler` pattern  

### 🔄 Changed
- `GormUpdateHandler` now uses typed structs instead of `map[string]interface{}` by default  
  - Preserves custom field types such as:
    - `JSONB[T]`
    - custom enums
    - embedded structs  
  - Prevents type loss during updates that previously generated invalid SQL for JSONB fields  
  - Primary key protection is now enforced by restoring the persisted value before update  

### 🐛 Fixed
- Fixed PostgreSQL error when updating JSONB columns:
  - This happened because map-based updates converted JSON arrays into SQL record syntax like: ('A','B','C')

- Updates now correctly send valid JSON to PostgreSQL.

### 💥 Breaking Changes
- `GormUpdateHandler` no longer supports map-based dynamic updates  
- The previous behavior caused loss of type information and broke JSONB and other custom types  
- If dynamic/unsafe updates are required, a dedicated patch-style handler must be implemented separately

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-28

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `GormGetList` no longer reads `*http.Request`
- Split into:
  - `GormGetList` → core data function without HTTP dependency
  - `GormGetListHttp` → HTTP helper that parses request and calls `GormGetList`

This change separates transport (HTTP) from data querying, making the core usable in non-HTTP contexts.
